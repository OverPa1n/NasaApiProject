# NASA API

----

> This project can show you an **Astronomy pictures of the day** and **image from the camera of Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit rovers** that launched by the United States as part of the Mars Exploration Rover project and currently is on Mars!

----

## How to start a project:
All main files is in **Public** directory
Firstly you cannot use a script file as a module without using a server.

**In short cannot use type="module" with file protocol**
### Here are some of the options:

>* Use Live Server (Extension for VS Code)
>* Use http-server module from node (install via npm then run http-server . from your project directory)
>* use http.server package from python
>* use a wamp (or lamp) server
> 


----

For me best option is use IDE **Live Server** or install **http-server** from npm:



> * npm install --global http-server
> * brew install http-server
> 
> [for more information visit: http-server npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Then open your terminal and type: **http-server**

You will see: 
>Available on:
> 
>http://192.168.1.79:8080
> 
>http://127.0.0.1:8080

Pick one of these host, and you will see a project in action


If you decided to use **Live Server** you need open **index.html** file in it that located in **Public** directory

----

Just open it on your browser and follow the prompts on **buttons**

----

### Also, I decided to use a some libraries:
>* Bootstrap 4
>* Animate CSS
> 
----
**P.S** Closure i have described in **RequestsToAPI.js** file

I will be so pleased if someone send me either a feedback about code or my idea to:
